# fivem-loadingscreen

I made this loading screen at the request of a friend, but it was never used in the end. Maybe someone else can find it useful.

It is missing a few graphic files and the Assets folder itself. I think it should not be difficult for anyone to restore them by looking into index.html. If I manage to find the final version of this loading screen with the graphic files, I will add it here.
